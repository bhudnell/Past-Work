Intro:
    A long, long time ago, the kingdom in the land of 
Hyrule was at peace. The birds chirped, the flowers 
bloomed, the grass was green and the outside temperature
was a perfect 81.2 degrees fahrenheit. One day the prince 
of darkness, Ganondorf, came across Zelda's, princess of 
Hyrule, Facebook page. He became infatuated with her at 
first profile picture glance and had to have her as his bride.
    Zelda had no interest in any evil man for she was a 
gentle damsel. Zelda has also been in love with a young lad, 
Link, since forever ago. Unannounced, Ganondorf rolled up in 
Hyrule demanding Zelda's hand in marriage. Highly offended by 
Zelda's rejection, Ganondorf called his army causing havoc and 
chaos upon the kingdom of Hyrule. He managed to take Zelda and 
ride off.
    Link who had been nappin' in the fields missed the whole 
thing. He loved Zelda dearly and could not stand the thought
of her being unhappy. After he had supper, Link was off to
save his true love.
Level 1:
    As you continue to walk through the dark woods you spot a light.
You notice the light coming closer. OMG it is Ganon on his horse and
Zelda, held hostage in the carriage. Since you ate your spinach 
you manage to stop Ganon's horse. You made Ganondorf very mad and next
thing you notice a boxing ring falling down from the heavens. 
Level 2:
    After 20 long days, a few mosquito bites, and almost falling off a 
cliff, you have made it to Ganondorf's kingdom, Dorf Land. As you approach
the the palace doors you notice Zelda locked up in a cabin. Since you
drank your protein shake you manage to set her free. But you made a lot of
noise and next thing you notice another boxing ring falling down form 
the heavens. You are not alone in this fight for Zelda is with you now.
